# Motion-Detection
This project uses OpenCV in Python to create a motion detection system. Frame comparison, noise reduction, and fundamental motion tracking are used in the system's analysis of video input to detect motion. Setup, motion detection, noise reduction, and basic tracking are all included in the scope.
